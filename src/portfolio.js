‚Ä¢ Helped the client in transforming their website built with HTML + CSS + JS (jQuery) to one built on a CMS (Adobe Experience Manager 6.2).
‚Ä¢ Followed Component-Driven Development (CDD) methodology to write HTML + CSS + JS components in AEM which can then be placed by the website authors to create the required behavior.
‚Ä¢ Implemented the UI for login and registration functionalities - two of the most important functionalities of the website along with the integration of services written in Node.js.
‚Ä¢ Developed the components keeping Internationalization (i18n) in mind.
‚Ä¢ Helped in the implementation of the analytics on the website using DTM (Dynamic Tag Management) which is a part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud for tracking the visitors.
‚Ä¢ Followed the Agile methodology and worked closely with BAs and testers using JIRA as a platform for tracking stories and bringing them to completion on target times.

In another project, I worked as an Angular developer.
‚Ä¢ Worked on the creation of a Single Page Application (SPA) - a dashboard for tracking the assets of the users.
‚Ä¢ Divided the application into multiple feature modules acting as logical divisions to decrease the complexity of development.
‚Ä¢ Created reusable components that were used in multiple places across the application.
‚Ä¢ Created services to consume the back-end API and these services were then injected in the components to populate charts.
‚Ä¢ Implemented the routing in the application.
‚Ä¢ Created forms using template-driven and reactive approaches to engage the users, validated user actions on the client-side and provided responsive feedback.
